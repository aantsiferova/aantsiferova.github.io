  abstract = {Quality assessment is essential to creating and comparing video compression algorithms. Despite the development of many new quality-assessment methods, well-known and generally accepted codecs comparisons mainly employ classical methods such as PSNR, SSIM, and VMAF. These methods have different variations: temporal pooling techniques, color-component summations and versions. In this paper, we present comparison results for generally accepted video-quality metrics to determine which ones are most relevant to video codecs comparisons. For evaluation we used videos compressed by codecs of different standards at three bitrates, and subjective scores were collected for these videos. Evaluation dataset consists of 789 encoded streams and 320294 subjective scores. VMAF calculated for all Y, U, V color spaced showed the best correlation with subjective quality, and we also showed that the usage of smaller weighting coefficients for U and V components leads to a better correlation with subjective quality.},

  abstract = {Nowadays neural-network-based image- and video-quality metrics show better performance compared to traditional methods. However, they also became more vulnerable to adversarial attacks that increase metrics' scores without improving visual quality. The existing benchmarks of quality metrics compare their performance in terms of correlation with subjective quality and calculation time. However, the adversarial robustness of image-quality metrics is also an area worth researching. In this paper, we analyse modern metrics' robustness to different adversarial attacks. We adopted adversarial attacks from computer vision tasks and compared attacks' efficiency against 15 no-reference image/video-quality metrics. Some metrics showed high resistance to adversarial attacks which makes their usage in benchmarks safer than vulnerable metrics. The benchmark accepts new metrics submissions for researchers who want to make their metrics more robust to attacks or to find such metrics for their needs. Try our benchmark using pip install robustness-benchmark.},

  abstract = {Video-quality measurement is a critical task in video processing. Nowadays, many implementations of new encoding standards - such as AV1, VVC, and LCEVC - use deep-learning-based decoding algorithms with perceptual metrics that serve as optimization objectives. But investigations of the performance of modern video- and image-quality metrics commonly employ videos compressed using older standards, such as AVC. In this paper, we present a new benchmark for video-quality metrics that evaluates video compression. It is based on a new dataset consisting of about 2,500 streams encoded using different standards, including AVC, HEVC, AV1, VP9, and VVC. Subjective scores were collected using crowdsourced pairwise comparisons. The list of evaluated metrics includes recent ones based on machine learning and neural networks. The results demonstrate that new no-reference metrics exhibit high correlation with subjective quality and approach the capability of top full-reference metrics.},
